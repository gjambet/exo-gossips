# if you are taking the exercise

1. Please Fork the repo, work on your own fork.
2. Difficulty is increasing, solve test one by one, we want to see your progression not the overall solution magically jump out of the hat.
3. Please commit & push each time a new test becomes green.
4. Keep in mind that this is a session to asses/discuss your coding skills : how you are doing things is as important for us as passing all the tests.
5. We want to understand what 'best production-ready' code means for you (this is not an invitation to over-engineering, please don't we hate that.)

You're not allowed to change the tests

Good luck :D



# if you are benching the exercise

up to you, but feel free to create your own branch to host your solution and discuss it with team mates
please commit somewhere or tell me how long it took you to perform

Guillaume.
